engine, api: fixed bug in managedTask.containerNextState for handling terminal containers

* bug: Container transition for RUNNING -> STOPPED was deemed in-actionable in this
  method. Modified it so that if container's known status is RUNNING or
  RESOURCES_PROVISIONED, we return true for the action needed flag
* The managedTask.handleStoppedToRunningContainerTransition method has been
  refactored to get rid of chained if conditions so that its easier to read
* The DockerTaskEngine's transition function map has been refactored as a field
  in the DockerTaskEngine. This helps in testing as we can override this map
  in our tests. Ideally we would have used an interface method. But, that's a
  bigger refactor for another day
* Added unit tests for task manager for steady state == RESOURCES_PROVISIONED
